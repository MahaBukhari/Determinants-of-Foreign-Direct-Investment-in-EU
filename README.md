**Foreign Direct Investment in the EU: Determinants and Insights**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is central to economic integration, capital flows, and growth within the European Union. Yet, FDI is not evenly distributed across member states. Why do some economies consistently attract large inflows while others lag behind? This project investigates the economic and institutional determinants of FDI across 27 EU countries between 2000 and 2024, drawing on panel data and econometric analysis.

**Research Focus**

Examines the influence of market size, public debt, trade openness, unemployment, and political stability on FDI inflows.

Evaluates whether political stability within the EU reduces the explanatory power of some commonly cited factors.

**Methodology**

Balanced panel dataset covering 27 EU member states, 2000–2024.

Data processing includes log transformations and winsorization to manage skewness and outliers.

Estimation strategies: Fixed Effects (FE) and Random Effects (RE) models, with the Hausman test guiding model selection.

Robustness checks for heteroskedasticity and multicollinearity.

**Main Findings**

Market size and trade openness emerge as the strongest and most consistent drivers of FDI.

Public debt significantly deters FDI, reflecting investors’ sensitivity to fiscal sustainability.

Unemployment and political stability show weaker explanatory power, likely because EU membership already provides a baseline of institutional and political security.

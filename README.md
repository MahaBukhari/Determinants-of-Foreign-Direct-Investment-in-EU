# Determinants-of-Foreign-Direct-Investment-in-EU
This repository presents an empirical study of the determinants of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the European Union (EU) using a panel dataset of 27 countries from 2001 to 2025. The analysis investigates how market size, macroeconomic stability, trade openness, public debt, unemployment, and political stability influence FDI inflows across member states.
The project is implemented in Stata, and the results are presented in a Jupyter Book / GitHub Pages format similar to a digital handbook.

**Research Motivation**

FDI is a key driver of growth, technology transfer, and integration into global value chains. The EU, as one of the worldâ€™s largest and most integrated economic regions, provides a unique case for analyzing how different economic and institutional factors attract foreign investors. This study addresses three core questions:

Does market size (GDP) remain the strongest determinant of FDI in the EU?

Does trade openness amplify FDI inflows within the single market?

Do fiscal and institutional factors (e.g., debt, political stability) affect investor decisions?

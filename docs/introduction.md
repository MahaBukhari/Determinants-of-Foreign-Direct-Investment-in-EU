**Introduction**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a central role in shaping the
economic trajectory of the European Union (EU). It fuels capital
formation, fosters technology transfer, strengthens global value chain
participation, and stimulates economic growth. Yet, the determinants of
FDI are complex and multidimensional, often varying across countries and
periods. Understanding these determinants within the EU is particularly
important because the region offers unique features: a large integrated
market, a common institutional framework, and recurring fiscal and
monetary challenges.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the determinants of FDI in
27 EU countries over the period 2001--2025. Using a balanced panel
dataset, the analysis examines the role of **market size (GDP)**,
**macroeconomic stability (inflation, unemployment, public debt)**,
**openness to trade**, and **political stability** in attracting FDI.
The methodology relies on panel econometric techniques---Fixed Effects
(FE) and Random Effects (RE)---with the Hausman test guiding model
selection. Data cleaning steps, including logarithmic transformations
and winsorization, were implemented to address skewness, kurtosis, and
outliers, ensuring reliable estimation.

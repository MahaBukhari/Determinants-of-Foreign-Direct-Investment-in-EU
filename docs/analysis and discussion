<p><strong>Analysis and Discussion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pooled OLS</strong></p>
<p>The preliminary OLS regression confirmed the expected positive
influence of <strong>GDP</strong> and <strong>trade openness</strong> on
FDI. However, by ignoring country-specific unobserved factors, OLS
results risked omitted-variable bias. For instance, structural
characteristics like geography, institutions, or culture could not be
controlled for, despite likely affecting both FDI inflows and
macroeconomic variables.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed vs Random Effects</strong></p>
<p>Panel estimation allowed for better control of heterogeneity. The
Breusch-Pagan test indicated heteroskedasticity, making robust standard
errors necessary. The Hausman test (p = 0.003) strongly favored the
<strong>Fixed Effects model</strong>, showing that unobserved country
characteristics are correlated with the regressors. This is highly
logical in the EU context: institutional quality, legal systems, and
long-term fiscal credibility differ across member states and cannot be
assumed random.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Effects Results</strong></p>
<p>The FE model with robust errors produced three key findings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Market Size (GDP)</strong> – Consistently positive and
significant. Larger economies attract more FDI, consistent with theories
of market-seeking investment. This is evident in countries like Germany,
France, and Italy, where large consumer markets and production networks
act as magnets for foreign investors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trade Openness</strong> – The strongest and most
significant determinant. In the EU, trade openness is amplified by the
single market, which eliminates internal barriers and allows investors
to access the entire bloc through a single entry point. This integration
effect makes trade openness a particularly powerful driver of
FDI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public Debt</strong> – Negative and significant. Higher
debt levels deter foreign investors, reflecting concerns about fiscal
sustainability, potential austerity, and future taxation. The Eurozone
debt crisis (2009–2014) exemplifies how rising debt undermined investor
confidence in several EU countries.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast, <strong>unemployment</strong> and <strong>political
stability</strong> were statistically insignificant. This is plausible:
within the EU, unemployment varies but is often viewed as cyclical,
while political stability is broadly guaranteed by EU-level
institutions. Investors may thus prioritize economic fundamentals over
these factors.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This study provides strong empirical evidence on the determinants of
FDI in the EU. Three clear conclusions emerge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Market size and trade openness are the most robust and
powerful drivers of FDI.</strong> Foreign investors prioritize larger
markets and seamless access to the EU single market when deciding where
to locate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fiscal sustainability matters.</strong> Public debt
emerges as a significant deterrent to FDI, underlining the importance of
prudent fiscal management. Investors remain sensitive to risks of
instability stemming from excessive government borrowing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secondary factors such as unemployment and political
stability play limited roles within the EU.</strong> Because of the
region’s institutional cohesion and relative stability, these variables
do not significantly explain FDI variations across member
states.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From a policy perspective, the findings suggest that EU governments
can strengthen their attractiveness to foreign investors by (a)
maintaining open trade regimes, (b) sustaining large and dynamic
domestic markets through growth policies, and (c) keeping public debt
levels in check. While political stability and labor market conditions
remain important for long-term growth, it is the combination of
openness, scale, and fiscal credibility that most convincingly attracts
FDI in the European Union.</p>
